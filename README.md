Welcome to **Dermanow**, a trust-focused blockchain donation platform created to restore transparency and accountability in charitable giving.

This platform was built using modern web technologies including **React**, **Vite**, and **Solidity**, with **Supabase** powering our backend and smart contracts deployed via **Thirdweb**.
